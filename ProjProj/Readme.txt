	(7) Notes
		-This is written in Ti-Basic and does have limitations, I tried to 
		add grayscale in several parts in the game. For best results use 
		a Ti-84+SE. 
		-I am not responsible for any crashes or hardware malfunctions, use at own
		risk.
		-Any modifications to the program is at own risk, again I take no responsibility
