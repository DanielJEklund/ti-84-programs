CSE PRETTY MATH README 				        this wide
----------------------------------------------------------------->
Explanation:
Pretty Math for the CSE, allows user mathmatical input and 
displays answers in "pretty" form, which is easier to read than
the calculators own math functions.
This release is for the Ti-84 Plus C Silver Edition only, and
will not work on other calculator models. At only ~1200 bytes total,
memory should not be a problem.

Installation:
Send the following programs to the Ti-84 Plus C Silver Edition:
-prgmBIG
-prgmFIND
-prgmMAINCAS (Run this from program menu to start)
-prgmMANY
-prgmSTRTONUM
-prgmTYPE


Important Information:
While this is in final stages of development, there are a few rules
that NEED to be followed in order for it to work. 
NOTE: All math will be preformed left to right, not following
PEMDAS standards.
Supported Operations:
+: Use normally, ex: 2+31+17+20 = 70
-: " ", ex: 32-10 = 22
*: " ", ex: 5*15 = 75
/: " ", ex: 15/5 = 3
^: " ", ex: 2^3 = 8
=: Evaluates left side than compares to what is right of "=",
    ex: 15+5-3*2 = 34 will return "True" 
    ex: 15+5-3*2 = 33+1 will return "False" (compares to 33)
>: Similair to "=" evaluates left and compares to right of operator
<: " "
"HELP": Entering HELP into operation bar will return a small help
    file.
"QUIT": Entering QUIT into operation bar will return to home screen.
