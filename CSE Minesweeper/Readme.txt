HOW TO PLAY
-The object of minesweeper is to correctly flag all
mines on the field. You flag mines so you won't click
on them. Losing happens when you select a mine; you
blow up. So by flagging all mines correctly, you win
the game.
-The game starts out with no tiles selected, with a 
movable cursor, mouse etc, which can select tiles and
turn the tiles on. Tiles that are on will have a 
number displayed, this number is how many mines
are touching the particular square. Mines can touch
a square by being next to it or diagonal to it. 
-For example a square with a 3 on it means 3 bombs
are touching that square.
-By using logic you can succesfully flag all mines 
on the field. For more help on how to play, just
google it.
